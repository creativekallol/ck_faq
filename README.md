## üìå Plugin Configuration

After installation, follow these steps:

3.	Add FAQ records to a dedicated sys folder.
4.	Optionally, customize templates and styles via your sitepackage extension.
5.	Adjust TypoScript settings manually or through the Constant Editor.

### Available Configuration Options:

### üåê SEO-Friendly Routing Advice

For optimal URL structure, you are encouraged to write your own custom site configuration using YAML. Alternatively, you may refer to the following example:

```yaml
routeEnhancers:
  Category:
    type: Extbase
    extension: CkFaq
    plugin: Pi1
    routes:
      -
        routePath: '/{slug}'
        _controller: 'Faq::list'
        _arguments:
          slug: category
      -
        routePath: '/{slug}/page-{currentPage}'
        _controller: 'Faq::list'
        _arguments:
          slug: category
          currentPage: currentPage
      -
        routePath: '/page-{currentPage}'
        _controller: 'Faq::list'
        _arguments:
          currentPage: currentPage
    defaultController: 'Faq::list'
    aspects:
      slug:
        type: PersistedAliasMapper
        tableName: sys_category
        routeFieldName: slug
      currentPage:
        type: StaticRangeMapper
        start: '1'
        end: '100'
    requirements:
      product-slug: '^[a-z0-9\-]+$'
    limitToPages:
      - 2  # Replace with your actual FAQ plugin page ID
```

### üìù TODO

1. Turn ON/OFF the entire Rating feature, so that FAQ can be used with or without rating system
2. Configure use of Bootstrap 5 CDN only if it is not available in sitepackage
3. Enable rating system based on logged-in frontend users.
4. Make the plugin configurable to allow update of rating data in real time or via batch processing (important for high-traffic websites).
